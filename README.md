# AO3 Favorite Tags RSS Feeds

This repository automatically generates and updates RSS feeds for my favorite AO3 tags.

## How It Works

- The script runs every 6 hours using GitHub Actions
- For tags that already have RSS feeds on AO3, direct links are provided
- For tags without native RSS support, custom feeds are generated by scraping the tag pages
- All feeds exclude works tagged as "Explicit" and "Alpha/Beta/Omega Dynamics"

## Feed Links

Visit the [project page](https://mor-lays.github.io/favao3tags/) to get feed URLs for all tags.

## Adding to Your RSS Reader

Simply copy the feed URL for any tag and add it to your RSS reader of choice (like Feedly or Inoreader).
